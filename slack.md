# FUN with Slack

In this section, we will describe our best practices when using Slack.

## Asynchronicity

Slack is used:
- for real-time discussion when two or more persons are actively connected at the same time,
- to replace emails when sharing information or for asynchronous conversation.

When you post a message to someone on Slack, you should not expect them to answer synchronously.

In other words, consider your messages like emails:
- communicate the whole point before pressing "Enter" and not just "hello are you here?" or
  "are you available to talk?",
- if the person answers straightaway, it means that he or she may be available to chat, but you
  should not expect it to be the case by default,
- give the person some time to answer: at least a few hours, unless the matter is unusually
  urgent. They can decide how fast they need to answer you, because you have given them the
  whole information in your message, right?

## Threads

We want technical discussions to happen in public channels as much as possible and not in private/group channels:
- someone else may have a good idea,
- someone else may learn something by reading your discussion.

In order to limit the noise for people not directly interested in your topic, switch to a "thread"
as soon as you notice that a conversation is initiating.
