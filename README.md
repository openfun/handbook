# FUN handbook

In this handbook you will find best practices we introduced at [FUN](https://www.fun-mooc.fr) \(France Université Numérique\); it is mainly focused on technical considerations of FUN's mission, _i.e. _ how we code collaboratively, how we communicate with remote worker, etc.



This book is constantly evolving as some practices may need to be refined or introduced. Feel free to contribute by proposing changes, giving us feedback or asking questions about how we work at FUN.
